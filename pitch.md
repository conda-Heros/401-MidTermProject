## Project 1: Classification of Chronic kidney disease depending on Machine learning trained model

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should , the main idea of our project is to do a machine learning classification task using a trained model we will build in order to classify a set of data for a patent medical tests he had.

problem domain is diseses discovery , by exploring the pattern in data we can make a good predection if any patient with a set of medical examinations we can predict if he is injured or not.

MVP : 

* We expect if we trained the model well and get a highest values of evalution and we can predict the class of observation if it positive or negative .

* We expect that we will discover some facts about the disease by discovering the relations between the features of dataset 

Future Goal:

* We expect if we have a chance in the following weeks to implement our idea with a web application for the user use he can enter his medical examinations related and the application will give him a predection if his state is positve or not

## Project 2: Space invadors GUI Game

Space Invaders is a shooting arcade game , The objective of the game is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen, the idea of our project is to is to build a GUI pythonic game that any player can play It.

Problem domain is software development skills improvment by implementing a game using pythonic style

MVP : 

* We expect that we will implement a fully playable game with a great user experince that when the user play it.

* We expect we have a game with a user selection of difficulties easy, medium and hard.

* we expect to have highly intelligent npcs (are friendly automated non-player characters that provide services to players.) and bosses(a significant computer-controlled enemy.) 

Future Goal:

* We expect our project will be a core of bigger idea to inforce the game by the computer for getting a highest score when the computer play the game alone as a future goal to make our game intellegance using reinforcement learning
