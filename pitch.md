### This is a list of projects we are agreed as a team with to start working on midterm project of Code 401 Level

## Project 1: Classification of Chronic kidney disease depending on Machine learning trained model

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should , the main idea of our project is to do a machine learning classification task using a trained model we will build in order to classify a set of data for a patent medical tests he had.

problem domain is diseses discovery , by exploring the pattern in data we can make a good predection if any patient with a set of medical examinations we can predict if he is injured or not.

MVP : we expect if we trained the model well to get a highest accuracy and we can predict the class of observation if it positive or negative .

## Project 2: Classification of Hepatitis disease depending on Machine learning trained model

Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver, , the main idea of our project is to do a machine learning classification task using a trained model we will build in order to classify a set of data for a patent medical tests he had.
